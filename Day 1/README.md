# Data Exploration with the Iris Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on introduction to data exploration and visualization using the Iris dataset. It is designed to help learners understand key steps in preparing and analyzing data for machine learning tasks.

## Objectives
- Learn how to load and explore datasets.
- Visualize data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- Perform basic data preprocessing and mapping.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Dataset Loading**
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Loading the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Viewing the dataset structure and first few rows.
   - Checking for missing values and understanding the target variable.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Plotting data distributions.
   - Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Mapping numerical target labels to species names.
   - Preparing the dataset for further analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the `ML_101_Day_1.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command in a code cell:
   ```bash
   !pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
4. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to understand and implement the concepts.

## How to Use This Notebook
- Execute the code cells to understand the data exploration process.
- Modify the examples to experiment with different datasets or visualizations.
- Please look at the comments and markdown sections for detailed explanations.
